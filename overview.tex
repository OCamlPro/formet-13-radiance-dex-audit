\section{Code Architecture}

The infrastructure is composed of a set of DEX specific contracts,
associated with tokens contracts (developed by Broxus, to the best of
our knownledge).

The DEX contracts are :

\begin{description}
\item[DEXroot:] The ``root'' contract, used to perform global
  operations, such as creating ``client'' contracts;
\item[DEXClient:] The contract with which a user may interact with the
  system.
\item[DEXPair:] The contract associated with a given pair of tokens
  (root token contracts)
\item[DEXConnector:] A simplified interface to interact with token
  contracts. The goal is probably to be able to interact with
  different implementations/interfaces of token contracts.
\end{description}

The token contracts are :

\begin{description}
\item[RootTokenContract:] The root token contract, shared by all the
  wallet contracts for a given token;
\item[TONTokenWallet:] The wallet contract, containing the balance
  associated either with a public key or (exclusive) a contract
  address;
\end{description}

Compared to
\url{https://github.com/broxus/broxus/ton-eth-bridge-token-contracts/},
the two token contracts have only been modified to change the {\tt
  ton-solidity} pragma version.

All the DEX contracts use a static {\tt soUINT} field to be able to
instanciate several ones for a given public key or other static field.

\section{Contracts Architecture}

The DEX is organized around the {\tt DEXroot} contract. The {\tt
  DEXroot} contract performs mainly two operations, {\tt
  createDEXclient} to create a new client contract for an external
user, and {\tt createDEXpair} for a client to create a new pair
contract.

Once the some users have created some {\tt DEXPair} for some tokens
using their {\tt DEXClient} contract, using the {\tt createNewPair}
public method, users can use the {\tt connectPair} public method to
register the pair in the client. Users should also use {\tt
  connectRoot} public methods to associate {\tt DEXConnector}
contracts to each token of the {\tt DEXPair}, i.e. a wallet associated
to the two tokens of the pair, plus the liquidity token.

Once a user has registered his client to the pair and created the
corresponding connectors, he may swap tokens using the {\tt
  processSwapA} and {\tt processSwapB} public methods, provide
liquidities using the {\tt processLiquidity} public method, or refund
his liquidities using the {\tt returnLiquidity} public method.

\section{Sequences of Messages}

\subsection{{\tt createDEXclient} sequence}

\begin{itemize}
\item The user transfers some TONs to the {\tt DEXroot} contract from
  his multisig;
\item The user sends a {\tt setCreator} message to the {\tt DEXroot}
  contract to claim ownership for the former transferred tokens;
\item The user sends a {\tt createDEXclient} message to the {\tt
  DEXroot} contract;
\item The {\tt DEXroot} contract deploys the {\tt DEXClient} contract;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\tt createDEXpair} sequence}

\begin{itemize}
\item The user sends a {\tt createNewPair} message to his {\tt
  DEXClient} contract, providing the two root token contracts to be
  swapped;
\item The client contract sends a {\tt createDEXpair} message to the
  {\tt DEXroot} contract.
\item The root contract:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Deploys a {\tt RootTokenContract} contract to create the
    token later used for liquidity management;
  \item Deploys a {\tt DEXPair} contract for the pair;
  \end{itemize}
\item The {\tt DEXPair} constructor deploys two {\tt DEXConnector}
  contracts, one for each token of the pair (see the {\tt
    DEXConnector} deployment sequence)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\tt DEXConnector} deployment sequence}

\begin{itemize}
\item A contract ({\tt DEXClient} or {\tt DEXPair}, the {\em
  owner}) deploys a {\tt DEXConnector} contract;
\item The contract immediately sends a {\tt deployEmptyWallet} message
  to the {\tt DEXConnector} contract;
\item The connector contract:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sends a {\tt deployEmptyWallet} message to the {\tt
    RootTokenContract} contract;
  \item Sends a {\tt sendExpectedWalletAddress} message to the {\tt
    RootTokenContract} contract;
  \end{itemize}
\item The root token contract:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Deploys the empty {\tt TONTokenWallet} contract;
  \item Sends a {\tt expectedWalletAddressCallback} message to the
    {\tt DEXConnector} contract
  \end{itemize}
\item The connector sends a {\tt connectCallback} message to the
  initial {\em owner} contract ({\tt DEXClient} or {\tt DEXPair});
\item The {\em owner} contract sends:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A {\tt setTransferCallback} to the {\tt DEXConnector} contract;
  \item A {\tt setBouncedCallback} to the {\tt DEXConnector} contract;
  \end{itemize}
\item The {\tt DEXConnector} contract forwards the {\tt
  setReceiveCallback} and {\tt setBouncedCallback} messages to the
  {\tt TONTokenWallet} contract;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\tt connectPair} sequence}

\begin{itemize}
\item The user sends a {\tt connectPair} message to his {\tt
  DEXClient} contract;
\item The client contract sends a {\tt connect} message to the {\tt
  DEXPair} contract;
\item The {\tt DEXPair} contract sends back its information through a
  {\tt setPair} message;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\tt processSwapA} sequence}

\begin{itemize}
\item The user sends a {\tt processSwapA} message to his {\tt
  DEXClient} contract;
\item The client contract sends a {\tt transfer} message to the {\tt
  DEXConnector} contract, with a payload {\tt (1,rootB,walletB)} ;
\item The {\tt DEXConnector} contract forwards the {\tt transfer}
  message to the associated {\tt TONTokenWallet} contract;
\item The {\tt TONTokenWallet} contract sends a {\tt internalTransfer}
  message to the destination {\tt TONTokenWallet} contract of the
  pair;
\item The destination {\tt TONTokenWallet} contract sends a {\tt
  tokensReceivedCallback} message to his associated {\tt DEXPair}
  contract;
\item The {\tt DEXPair} checks whether the swap is possible or not:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If the swap is not possible, it sends a {\tt transfer} message
    to the {\tt DEXConnector} to refund the user, with a {\tt (8,0,0)}
    payload;
  \item If the swap is possible, it sends a {\tt transfer} message to
    the other {\tt DEXConnector} to pay the user, with a {\tt (0,0,0)}
    payload;
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\tt processLiquidity} sequence}

\begin{itemize}
\item The user sends a {\tt processLiquidity} message to his {\tt
  DEXClient} contract;
\item The client contract sends a {\tt transfer} message to the two
  associated {\tt DEXConnector} contracts, with a payload {\tt
    (2,dexclient,walletLiquidity)} ;
\item The {\tt DEXConnector} contracts forward the {\tt transfer}
  messages to the associated {\tt TONTokenWallet} contracts;
\item The {\tt TONTokenWallet} contracts send {\tt internalTransfer}
  messages to the destination {\tt TONTokenWallet} contracts of the
  pair;
\item The destination {\tt TONTokenWallet} contracts send {\tt
  tokensReceivedCallback} messages to their associated {\tt DEXPair}
  contract;
\item TODO
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\tt returnLiquidity} sequence}

\begin{itemize}
\item The user sends a {\tt returnLiquidity} message to his {\tt
  DEXClient} contract;
\item The client contract sends a {\tt burn} message to the user's
  {\tt DEXConnector} contract of the liquidity token, with a payload
  {\tt (3,walletA,walletB)} ;
\item The {\tt DEXConnector} contracts forwards a {\tt burnByOwner}
  message to his associated {\tt TONTokenWallet} contract;
\item The {\tt TONTokenWallet} contract burns the tokens and sends a
  {\tt tokensBurned} message to the associated {\tt
    RootTokenContract} contract;
\item The {\tt RootTokenContract} contract sends a {\tt burnCallback}
  message to the associated {\tt DEXPair} contract (provided in the
  initial {\tt burn} message);
\item The {\tt DEXPair} contract sends {\tt transfer} messages to the
  two {\tt DEXConnector} contracts to transfer back the tokens
  corresponding to the liquidity, with a payload of {\tt (6,0,0)};
\item The {\tt DEXConnector} contracts send {\tt transfer} messages to
  the corresponding {\tt TONTokenWallet} contracts;
\item The {\tt TONTokenWallet} contracts send {\tt internalTransfer}
  to the dexclient {\tt TONTokenWallet} contracts;
\item The {\tt TONTokenWallet} contracts of the dexclient send {\tt
  tokensReceivedCallback} messages to the dexclient, that records the
  callbacks in the {\tt callbacks} mapping;
\end{itemize}
