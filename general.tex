In this chapter, we introduce some general remarks about the code,
that are not specific to this project, but whose occurrences have been
found in the project in several locations.

\section{Readability}

\subsection{Typography}

\issueMinor{Typography of static variables}{A good coding convention
  is to use typography to visually discriminate static variables from
  other variables, for example using a prefix such as {\tt s\_}. }

(this issue was found everywhere in the code of DEX and token contracts)\\

\issueMinor{Typography of global variables}{A good coding convention
  is to use typography to visually discriminate global variables from local variables, for example using a prefix such as {\tt m\_} or {\tt g\_}. }

(this issue was found everywhere in the code of DEX and token contracts)\\

\issueMinor{Typography of internal function}{A good coding convention
  is to use typography to visually discriminate public functions and internal functions, for example using a prefix such as {\tt \_}. }

(this issue was found everywhere in the code of DEX and token contracts)\\


\subsection{Naming of Errors}

\issueMinor{Naming of Errors}{A good coding convention is to define constants instead of using direct numbers for errors in {\tt require()}.}

(this issue was found everywhere in the code of DEX contracts, but not
for token contracts)

\section{Security}
